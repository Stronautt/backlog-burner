# BacklogBurner 🔥

**Turning "Feature Requests" into "Feature Reality" with skin in the game.**

Open Source is amazing, but maintainer burnout and "stale" backlogs are real. **BacklogBurner** is a transparent, decentralized prioritization engine that allows users to fund the features they actually need, ensuring developers get paid for the work that matters most.

> **The Philosophy:** Don't just star a repo. Fuel it.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Submit:** A user proposes a feature with a clear **Definition of Ready (DoR)**.
2. **Verify:** Our AI and Community Validators (think "Community Notes" for code) ensure the request is sane, non-duplicate, and technically feasible.
3. **Fuel:** Users add fixed-value tokens to the feature. The more tokens, the higher the priority.
4. **Burn:** Once a funding threshold is met, the project owner (or a verified contributor) implements the feature.
5. **Validate & Release:** The community verifies the Pull Request. If it meets the criteria, tokens are released to the developer.

## 🛠 Development Practices

We build **BacklogBurner on BacklogBurner**. To maintain high standards, we follow these core principles:

### 📋 Definition of Ready (DoR)

Every feature request must include:

* **User Story:** Clear "As a... I want... So that..." format.
* **Acceptance Criteria (AC):** Testable conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered "done."
* **Architectural Impact:** A brief note on which modules will be affected.

### 🛡 Validation & Trust

* **Proof of Code:** No payout without a linked, merged Pull Request.
* **Reputation-Based Review:** Validation weight is determined by a contributor's history and GitHub seniority.
* **The "Ghost" Protection:** If a funded feature isn't implemented by the deadline, the bounty opens up to the public or funds are returned to the users.

### ⚖️ Ethics & Open Source

* **Always OSS:** All projects on this platform must be open-source.
* **Marketing, Not Markets:** We position ourselves as a marketing and promotion service for OSS features, avoiding the legal complexity of financial exchanges.
